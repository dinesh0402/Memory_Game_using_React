### How it works :-
* ðŸ‘‰ The cards are shuffled using useEffect hook of React. Whenever, the game is over or the 'new game' button is pressed, it fires up and shuffles the cards.
* ðŸ‘‰ We maintain 2 useState hooks to check the state of the 2 slected cards.
* ðŸ‘‰ If the selected cards are same, the cards remain turned up and disabled.
* ðŸ‘‰ Else, they turn back and hide themselves for the next turn.

### Technologies used :-
* React.js
* Firebase (Hosting)
